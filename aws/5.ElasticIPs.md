IPv4 allows for 3.7 billion different addresses in the public space

### 1. Elastic IPs - have a fixed public IP for your instance

- With an Elastic IP address, you can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account.
- You can only have 5 Elastic IP in your account (you can ask AWS to increase that).
- Overall, <font color=blue>try to avoid using Elastic IP</font>:
  - They often reflect poor architectural decisions
  - Instead, use a random public IP and register a DNS name to it
  - Or, as we'll see later, use a Load Balancer and don't use a public IP

### 2. Placement Groups

- **Cluster** - clusters instances into a low-latency group in a single Availability Zone

  - Pros: Great network (10 Gbps bandwidth between instances with Enhanced Networking enabled - recommended)
  - Cons: If the rack fails, all instances fails at the same time
  - Use case:
    - Big Data job that needs to complete fast
    - Application that needs extremely low latency and high network throughput

- **Spread** - spreads instances across underlying hardware (max 7 instances per group per AZ)
  - Pros:
    - Can span across Availability Zones (AZ)
    - Reduced risk is simultaneous failure
    -  EC2 Instances are on different physical hardware
  - Cons: Limited to 7 instances per AZ per placement group
  - Use case:
    - Application that needs to maximize high availability
    - Critical Applications where each instance must be isolated from failure from each other

- **Partition** - spreads instances across many different partitions (which rely on different sets of racks) within an AZ. Scales to 100s of EC2 instances per group (Hadoop, Cassandra, Kafka)
  - Up to 7 partitions per AZ
  - Can span across multiple AZs in the same region
  - Up to 100s of EC2 instances
  - The instances in a partition do not share racks with the instances in the other partitions
  - A partition failure can affect many EC2 but won’t affect other partitions
  - EC2 instances get access to the partition information as metadata
  - Use cases: HDFS, HBase, Cassandra, Kafka

### 3. Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI)

<div align="center"><img src="https://img2022.cnblogs.com/blog/2122768/202204/2122768-20220416200752882-1929200770.png" style="zoom:57%"/></div>

- Logical component in a VPC that represents a **virtual network card**
- The ENI can have the following attributes:
  - Primary private IPv4, one or more secondary IPv4
  - One Elastic IP (IPv4) per private IPv4
  - One Public IPv4
  - One or more security groups
  - A MAC address
- You can create ENI independently and attach them on the fly (move them) on EC2 instances for failover
- Bound to a specific availability zone (AZ)

### 4. EC2 Hibernate
Under the hood: the RAM state is written to a file in the root EBS volume which must be encrypted
Use cases:

- long-running processing
- saving the RAM state
- services that take time to initialize

### 5. EC2 Hibernate – Good to know

- **Supported instance families** - C3, C4, C5, M3, M4, M5, R3, R4, and R5
- **Instance RAM size** - must be less than 150 GB
- **Instance size** - not supported for bare metal instances
- **AMI**: Amazon Linux 2, Linux AMI, Ubuntu & Windows…
- **Root Volume**: must be EBS, encrypted, not instance store, and large
- Available for On-Demand and Reserved Instances
- An instance cannot be hibernated more than 60 days

### 6. EC2 Nitro
Underlying Platform for the next generation of EC2 instances, Higher Speed EBS (Nitro is necessary for 64,000 EBS IOPS – max 32,000 on non-Nitro)

### 7. EC2 – Capacity Reservations

- Capacity Reservations ensure you have EC2 Capacity when needed
- Manual or planned end-date for the reservation
- No need for 1 or 3-year commitment
- Capacity access is immediate, you get billed as soon as it starts
- Specify:
  - The Availability Zone in which to reserve the capacity (only one)
  - The number of instances for which to reserve capacity
  - The instance attributes, including the instance type, tenancy, and platform/OS
  - Combine with Reserved Instances and Savings Plans to do cost saving
